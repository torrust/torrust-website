## **Hello, Torrust Community!**

We know you’ve been eagerly anticipating the next major release of Torrust, and we’re thrilled to announce that we’re one step closer. Today, we’re excited to unveil version v3.0.0-alpha.12, a milestone that locks in the features for our upcoming major release. This alpha release is a critical step in our development cycle, and your participation in testing and feedback is more important than ever.

## What's New in v3.0.0-alpha.12

In this release, we've focused on stabilizing the new features and refining the performance of Torrust. We’ve made several improvements under the hood that pave the way for a smoother user experience and better scalability. Here’s a quick rundown of what you can expect:

- **New features:** Permanent tracker keys and allow to upload pre-generated keys. That would help users who want to migrate to the Torrust Tracker without affecting their active users.
- **Improved configuration:** Configuration has been changed in both the Tracker and Index to make it clearer. Error messages have also been improved to help administrators to fix configuration errors.
- **Security Updates**.
- **UI/UX Refinements:** Minor tweaks and fixes to the user interface, enhancing usability and user experience.

The live demo is always updated to the latest version. We encourage you to explore it, try out the new features, and share your thoughts.
