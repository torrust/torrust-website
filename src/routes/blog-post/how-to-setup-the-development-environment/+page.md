## Introduction

Before explaining how to setup the development environment, it's important to understand how the Torrust Index works. The Torrust Index is composed of multiple services, each one with its own codebase and repository. The services are:

- A [BitTorrent Tracker](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker), which is responsible for tracking the torrents and providing the peers to the clients.
- The [Index](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index), which is a REST API that provides the data to the frontend.
- And the [Index GUI](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index-gui), which is a webapp that displays the data to the user.

<Image src="/images/posts/torrust-architecture.png" alt="Torrust Architecture" />

You do not need to setup all services to contribute to the Torrust Index, but in this article we will explain how to setup the full development environment, which includes all services. Sometimes you might want to contribute with a full feature that involves multiple services, so it's useful to have the full development environment setup.

Setting up the development environment requires to setup the three main services.

First, we need to create the folder (in this example, a temp folder) where we will store the repositories of our services.

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
cd /tmp/
mkdir -p torrust
cd torrust
```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="info">

This guide uses bash commands and it has been tested on Ubuntu Ubuntu 23.04. You should not encounter any problem if you are using a different Linux distribution, but there are some reported issues with Windows compilation for the Tracker. The installation scripts are very simple, so you can easily adapt them to your system or run the commands manually.

</Callout>

## Common Dependencies

If you are using SQLite3 as database driver for the Tracker or the Backend, you will need to install the following dependency:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
```

</CodeBlock>

## Set Up the Torrust Tracker

This tutorial is tested with this Rust version:

- rustc 1.80.0-nightly (9cdfe285c 2024-05-22)

Since we are using the openssl crate with the [vendored](https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/#vendored) feature, enabled, you will need to install the following dependencies:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev make
```

</CodeBlock>

Now, we will build the tracker and create the storage folders where persistent data like databases will be stored:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker.git \\
  && cd torrust-tracker \\
  && cargo build \\
  && mkdir -p ./storage/tracker/lib/database \\
  && mkdir -p ./storage/tracker/lib/tls \\
  && mkdir -p ./storage/tracker/etc
```

</CodeBlock>

You can run the Tracker with the following command:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
cargo run
```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="info">

NOTICE: You do not need to change the default values for development.

</Callout>

After running the Tracker with `cargo run` you should see the following output:

<CodeBlock lang="output">

```s
Finished `dev` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s
     Running `target/debug/torrust-tracker`

```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="info">

IMPORTANT: Every time you change the configuration you need to restart the service.

</Callout>

By default, if you don't specify any `Config.toml` file, the application will use this:

<CodeBlock lang="output">

```s
Loading default configuration file: `./share/default/config/tracker.development.sqlite3.toml` ...
```

</CodeBlock >

You can't change that file because it's a template included in the repo. If you want to set your custom configuration, you can either:

1. Use a different path for the config file.
2. Inject the configuration with an environment variable.

## Custom config file

First, copy the template file to the storage folder:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
cp share/default/config/tracker.development.sqlite3.toml storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml
```

</CodeBlock>

Then, you can change any value and finally run the tracker with:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
TORRUST_TRACKER_CONFIG_TOML_PATH="./storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml" cargo run
```

</CodeBlock>

That would give you this output:

<CodeBlock lang="output">

```s
TORRUST_TRACKER_CONFIG_TOML_PATH="./storage/tracker/etc/tracker.toml" cargo run
    Finished `dev` profile [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.09s

```

</CodeBlock>

## Inject the configuration with an environment variable

You can also inject the configuration with:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
TORRUST_TRACKER_CONFIG_TOML=`cat share/default/config/tracker.development.sqlite3.toml` cargo run
```

</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="info">

NOTICE: We load the whole file into the env var. This is not useful for development, but it's a different way to inject the configuration. It's used when running the tracker with docker.

</Callout>

The response should be like this:

<CodeBlock lang="json">

```json
{
	"torrents": 0,
	"seeders": 0,
	"completed": 0,
	"leechers": 0,
	"tcp4_connections_handled": 0,
	"tcp4_announces_handled": 0,
	"tcp4_scrapes_handled": 0,
	"tcp6_connections_handled": 0,
	"tcp6_announces_handled": 0,
	"tcp6_scrapes_handled": 0,
	"udp4_connections_handled": 0,
	"udp4_announces_handled": 0,
	"udp4_scrapes_handled": 0,
	"udp6_connections_handled": 0,
	"udp6_announces_handled": 0,
	"udp6_scrapes_handled": 0
}
```

</CodeBlock>

For more details about the Torrust Tracker, check the [Tracker documentation](https://docs.rs/torrust-tracker/).

## Set Up the Torrust Index

This tutorial has been tested with this Rust version:

- rustc 1.80.0-nightly (9cdfe285c 2024-05-22)

To run the tests you will also need to install a command line tool to handle torrent files called [imdl](https://github.com/casey/intermodal). You can install it with the following command:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
cargo install imdl
```

</CodeBlock>

You will also need to install a tool for database migrations if you are going to make changes to the database schema. We are using [SQLx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx). You can install it with the following command:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

</CodeBlock>

We will now clone the `torrust-index` repository:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```terminal
  git clone https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index.git \\
  && cd torrust-index \\
  && cargo build \\
  && mkdir -p ./storage/index/lib/database \\
  && mkdir -p ./storage/index/lib/tls
```

</CodeBlock>

You can run the Torrust Index with the following commands:

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```bash
TORRUST_INDEX_API_CORS_PERMISSIVE=true cargo run
```

</CodeBlock>

As you can see we are using the environment variable `TORRUST_IDX_BACK_CORS_PERMISSIVE` to enable a permissive CORS policy. The default port for the Backend is `3001` and for the web server serving the frontend application is `3000`. Since they are different ports, we need to tell the backend to allow requests from a different port so that the frontend can make request to the API. To know more about CORS, check the [Mozilla CORS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

After running the Index with `TORRUST_INDEX_API_CORS_PERMISSIVE=true cargo run` you should see the following output:

<CodeBlock lang="output">

```s
Loading configuration from default configuration file: `./share/default/config/index.development.sqlite3.toml` ...

```

</CodeBlock>

You should be able to load the API entrypoint on <http://0.0.0.0:3001/>

<Image src="/images/posts/torrust-backend-api-entrypoint-response-screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Torrust Backend API entrypoint response" />

For more details about the Torrust Index Backend, check the [Index Backend documentation](https://docs.rs/torrust-index/).

## Set Up the Torrust Index GUI

At the time of writing, the Index GUI requires:

- Node: `^v20.12.2`

The frontend is a [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) application.

The last repository we need to clone is the `torrust-index-gui` repository . Remember to install Node.js and we need to be in the torrust folder to clone the repository.

<CodeBlock lang="terminal">

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index-gui.git \\
  && cd torrust-index-gui \\
  && npm install \\
  && cp .env.local .env \\
  && npm run dev
```

</CodeBlock>

You should see the following output:

<Image src="/images/posts/how-to-setup-the-development-environment/npm-run-dev-output.png" alt="Screenshot of Torrust Index GUI running from the terminal" />

Go to <http://localhost:3000/torrents> and you should see the torrent list page page:

<Image src="/images/posts/how-to-setup-the-development-environment/index-gui-after-fresh-install.png" alt="Screenshot of torrent list page on the browser" />

For more details about the Torrust Index GUI, check the [Index GUI documentation](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-index-gui).

## Application Setup

There are some public pages like the torrent list or torrent details pages. But there are some pages that require authentication like the admin pages or the pages for uploading or editing torrents.

To access those pages you need to create an account. You can do it from the signup page:

<http://localhost:3000/signup>

<Callout type="info">

The first user created will be the <code>admin</code> user.

</Callout>

## Development tools

We found some tools very useful to develop the Torrust Tracker and Index. We hope you find them useful too.

- DB Browser for SQLite: <https://sqlitebrowser.org/>
- BitTorrent client: qBittorrent <https://www.qbittorrent.org/>
- Torrent file editor: imdl <https://github.com/casey/intermodal>
- DaisyUI component library: <https://daisyui.com/components/>

## Conclusion

As you can see, the Torrust Tracker and Index are very easy to set up. We hope you find this guide useful. You might have problems:

- Setting up some of the projects on Windows. [We are working on it](https://github.com/torrust/torrust-tracker/issues/325).
- Or with some missing system dependencies.
